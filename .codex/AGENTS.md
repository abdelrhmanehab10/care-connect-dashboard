## Plan Mode

- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.

## Tests

- Run `npm run typecheck` when validating TypeScript changes or when requested.
- Run `npm test` when validating behavior changes or when requested.
- If tests cannot run, explain why and what would be required.
